I'm a Computer Science student. But more importantly, I'm a creator. (Or at least, want to be)

Areas of interest:
* Game design and development
* Software engineering
* Multimedia

## What is this blog about?

This blog is in general split into two categories:
1. Your typical devblog, where I reflect on my areas of interest. This could include postmortems on personal projects, reflections on the CS education I've received, or helpful insight on public projects of mine.
2. Game blog, where I share (generally classic) games that I believe deserve more attention, in an environment where people are more accustomed to AAA games with beautiful 3D graphics... or just MOBA / FPS games. These are generally going to be written in Chinese, because they are meant to be shared.
